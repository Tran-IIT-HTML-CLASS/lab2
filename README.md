# lab2

This lab is a simplistic, sample form. The primary focus is on the css reset files, which come from Meyers reset as well as a customized css reset file for "Mobile-First" Design.


Homework assignment asks for "mobile-first" design, so try resizing window pane to test. Input boxes are made as an example, not technically required for the assignment (except email, phone number, Date of Birth).
